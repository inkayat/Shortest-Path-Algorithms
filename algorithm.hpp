/**
    @todo 
    * (Proceed) A* Algorithm, It is hard to implement this homework.
    * (Incompleted) Gready Best Search, It doesn't find shortest path for some cases.
    * (Incompleted) Genetic Algorithm, It is always find the solution but takes many times.
    * (Completed) Traveling Salesman Problem, It can be improved by greedy paradigm. In efficient way.
    * (Completed) Floyd-Warshall Algorithm. It uses dynamic programming optimization, more efficient than naive approach.
    * (Completed) Bellman–Ford Algorithm
    * (Completed) Dijkstra Algorithm, It is modified versiın of the A3 algorithm for weighted graph.
    * (Completed) Recursive Solution, It is kind of brute force to tried every possible ways to find shortest path. Inefficient way.
    * (Completed) Greedy Recursive Solution, It is recursive version with optimization. Better than recursion.
    * (Completed) Random Walk, It doesn't guaranteed to find shortest path. It also provide some optimistic approaches to find shortest way.Check API docs to more Infos.
